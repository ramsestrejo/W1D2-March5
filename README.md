# The Dev Workflow

Welcome to the fascinating world of software programming. In this lecture/demo we used the Monty Hall game to explore the software development workflow. 

We started with a hypothesis, and from there, we put together a list of steps to complete to simulate the game programmatically. That list became our algorithm that we later transformed into code. 

Once we completed our software application in javascript, and run the simulation a considerable number of times we were able to confirm our hypothesis about the probability of winning increases when a player switches his/her original choice.
